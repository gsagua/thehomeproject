      <p>The 'where are you from?' conversations can sometimes be exhausting.
         Just because some people you meet will be confused about who you are doesn't mean you don't have to be.
       Your ethnic background, your upbringing, where you are and where you have been  are all a part of you.
      no one can take that away from you. There is beauty in the inbetween, what you see and what you take from it.</p>

      <p> Establishing your cultural idenity is likely to be a journey, and that is more than ok.
        There is no rush
        You'll probably find new things, revisit old things, and mix things along the way.
        You can tell people as much or as little as you want. The important thing  is to enjoy the world.
        YOU ARE ENOUGH.

        <h3>Who are you missing today? Where are you missing today? Here are some things that might help make the most
          of where you are:
        </h3>
       
        <p>
          <li>LOOK BACK: You probably have some photos or videos with the person you miss/ at the place you miss.
          </li>
          <li> TALK: tell that friend abroad you miss them. Open a discussion about how you're feeling with someone you trust.
            Sometimes its nice to just have someone to listen and perhaps give advice.
          </li>
          <li> JOURNAL: This can help with processing how you feel. 
            You don't have to follow a structure - There are not rules.
          </li>
          <li> FOOD: Make or buy that food or snack that reminds you of the place.
          <li> PLAN: Travelling isn't always possible, but planning for when that opporunity comes can give you something to look forward to.
          </li>
          <li> BE CURIOUS: Wherever you are... there's an opportunity to experience many new things and create new amazing memories.
            Explore the city, meet new people, learn the local language (if applicable).
