      <h1> Let's rewind a bit...how did we get here?</h1>
      <p>We live in a globalised world. Over time, travelling for work, education and life experience
        has become easier. While migration isn't new, the evolution of travel and technology have led  to  'neo-norms' in the nature and consequences
       of it. One of these is the rise in the people in society who may consider themselves cultural inbetweeners because of their
       upbringing.
        </p>
      <p> The 'Third Culture' Kid was originally coined by sociologist Ruth Hill in the 1950's. These are
         children who's formative years are based in places different to where their parents would call home
         These children find themselves growing up in more than one culture, and so answers to questions like 'Where are you from'
         typically come with more than a one word sentence. </p>

        <h1>The Experience: Things to Know</h1>
       <p>
         <h3> General</h3>
         <li> A sense of stability may not necessarily be found in a place for TCKs. Often its from what we create for ourselves
         based off the cultures we've been exposed to. </li>
        <li> The experience varies from person to person. Some have lived in one place their whole lives while others have travelled
         a lot. Even so, Third culture kids often bond deeply from the understanding and lived experience of identifying with multiple cultures.</li>
         <li> There is a good chance that a fellow TCK you know would be a reliable travel buddy.</li>
         
       </p>
        <p> 
          <h3> The Good</h3>
        <li> Learning and being a part of the beauty of multiple cultures.</li>
          <li>Understanding random phrases from different languages</li>
        <li> Having a culturally  open mindset: the willingness to learn often opens up more of the world to us.</li>  
      </p>

        <h3> Ongoning Challanges</h3>
      <li> Establishing a sense of identiy/belonging: It is common for TCKs struggle with feeling like they fit in or feel 'lost' where they are.</li>
      <li>Missing loved ones aborad: Some of the nearest and dearest to TCKs are abroad.</li>
      <li>Dealing with grief of uprooting: While moving can be an exciting opportunity,
        isn't always easy no matter how many times you do.
       There is an entire life of people and routines being left behind which can be uncomfortable. </li>
